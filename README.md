# SmartWater Radar

An ESP32-based Smart Water Radar System that helps monitor and manage water usage efficiently.

## Overview

This project uses an ESP32 microcontroller to create a smart water monitoring system. It can help track water usage, detect leaks, and provide insights into water consumption patterns.

## Features

- Water flow monitoring
- Leak detection
- Real-time data visualization
- ESP32-based system
- Low power consumption

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 Development Board
- Water flow sensor
- Additional sensors (optional)
- Power supply

## Software Requirements

- ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework)
- CMake
- Python 3.x (for ESP-IDF tools)

## Building and Flashing

1. Set up ESP-IDF environment:
   ```bash
   . $HOME/esp/esp-idf/export.sh
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   idf.py build
   ```

3. Flash to your ESP32:
   ```bash
   idf.py -p (PORT) flash
   ```
   Replace (PORT) with your ESP32's serial port (e.g., /dev/ttyUSB0 on Linux or /dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART on macOS)

4. Monitor the output:
   ```bash
   idf.py monitor
   ```
